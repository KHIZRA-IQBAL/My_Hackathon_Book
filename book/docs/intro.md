# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive 13-week textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Course Overview

This textbook bridges artificial intelligence with embodied systems, preparing you to build and deploy intelligent robots that interact with the physical world.

### What You'll Learn

- Physical AI fundamentals and embodied intelligence
- ROS 2 for real-time robot control and communication
- Gazebo simulation for virtual robot testing
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for physics-accurate training
- Humanoid robot design and control strategies
- Conversational AI integration for human-robot interaction

## 13-Week Course Structure

### Week 1-2: Physical AI Foundations
Understand what Physical AI is, why embodied intelligence matters, and explore the major humanoid robotics companies (Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Figure AI, Sanctuary AI, Agility Robotics). Learn about sensor systems including LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, and force/torque sensors.

[Start Week 1-2](weeks/week-01-02-physical-ai/intro)

### Week 3-5: ROS 2 Programming
Master the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) - the industry standard middleware for robotics. Build real-time control systems, implement pub-sub communication patterns, and create modular robot software architectures.

### Week 6-7: Gazebo Simulation
Learn to simulate robots in virtual environments before deploying to hardware. Build test scenarios, validate control algorithms, and debug complex behaviors safely in Gazebo.

### Week 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Sim
Dive into physics-accurate simulation and reinforcement learning training. Use NVIDIA's Isaac platform to train neural network policies with realistic physics, lighting, and sensor simulation.

### Week 11-12: Humanoid Robot Design
Design and control humanoid robots. Implement bipedal locomotion, balance control, manipulation strategies, and understand the biomechanics of human-like movement.

### Week 13: Conversational AI Integration
Combine large language models with robotic systems. Build voice-controlled robots, implement task planning from natural language, and create intuitive human-robot interfaces.

## Prerequisites

### Required Background
- Python Programming: Functions, classes, NumPy, basic libraries
- Machine Learning Basics: Neural networks, training pipelines, loss functions
- Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, transformations
- Basic Calculus: Derivatives, gradients (helpful for control theory)

### System Requirements
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended) or Windows with WSL2
- Hardware: GPU with CUDA support (recommended for simulation)
- Software: Python 3.10+, ROS 2 Humble, Docker (optional)

## Why Physical AI Matters

The robotics industry is experiencing unprecedented growth. Humanoid robots are moving from research labs to real-world deployment:

- Tesla Optimus - Manufacturing and assistance tasks
- Boston Dynamics Atlas - Dynamic locomotion and parkour
- Figure AI - Foundation model-driven manipulation
- Agility Robotics Digit - Warehouse automation
- Sanctuary AI Phoenix - General-purpose assistance

Unlike digital AI systems, physical robots must:
- Handle sensor noise and measurement uncertainty
- Operate in real-time with strict latency constraints
- Ensure safety around humans and property
- Bridge the sim-to-real gap from virtual training to physical deployment
- Navigate unstructured environments without perfect information

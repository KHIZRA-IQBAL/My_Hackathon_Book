# Week 13: Conversational AI for Humanoid Robots

## Overview

The final module explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI into humanoid robot systems, enabling natural human-robot interaction. You will learn how to combine vision-language models (VLMs) like GPT-4V with robot control systems to create assistants that understand natural language commands and adapt to user preferences.

This module covers the complete pipeline from speech recognition and natural language understanding to grounded action execution, with a focus on safety, interpretability, and user experience. You'll build upon the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot from this course to create embodied conversational agents.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 13, you will be able to:

- Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems with ROS 2
- Design prompt engineering strategies for robotic task decomposition
- Implement vision-language models for multimodal perception and reasoning
- Build RAG pipelines that ground robot actions in documentation and manuals
- Evaluate safety and failure modes of LLM-controlled robots
- Deploy conversational interfaces for teleoperation and supervision

## Key Topics

1. **Speech Processing**: ASR (Whisper, Vosk), TTS (Coqui, Azure Speech), noise robustness
2. **Language Grounding**: Semantic parsing, action primitives, constraint satisfaction
3. **Vision-Language Models**: GPT-4V, LLaVA, CLIP for visual reasoning
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Vector databases, context injection, memory systems
5. **Safety & Ethics**: Prompt injection defenses, fallback behaviors, human oversight

## Content Status

📝 **Full content coming soon!** This module is currently under development. Check back for:
- Tutorials on integrating OpenAI/Anthropic APIs with ROS 2
- Example conversational robot applications (household assistance, industrial inspection)
- Video demos of voice-controlled humanoid robots
- Best practices for LLM safety in physical systems

For now, explore conversational AI research from labs like [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/) and [Google DeepMind Robotics](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action/).

## Course Capstone

This module culminates in a **final project** where you integrate all 13 weeks of content:

1. Build a complete humanoid robot application (simulation or hardware)
2. Implement ROS 2 control, perception, and planning systems
3. Add conversational AI for natural language interaction
4. Deploy and demonstrate your system with a public GitHub repository
5. Present a 10-minute video showcasing your robot's capabilities

**Congratulations on completing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum!** 🎉

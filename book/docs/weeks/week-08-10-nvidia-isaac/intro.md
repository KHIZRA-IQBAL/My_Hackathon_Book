# Week 8-10: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab

## Overview

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a cutting-edge simulation platform built on the Omniverse platform, offering photorealistic rendering and GPU-accelerated physics for training Physical AI systems at scale. This module introduces Isaac Sim for high-fidelity robot simulation and Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning (RL) workflows.

You will learn how to leverage parallel simulation environments, synthetic data generation, and domain randomization to train robust policies that transfer effectively to real hardware. This module bridges classical control (Weeks 3-7) with learning-based approaches that enable humanoid robots to adapt to unstructured environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 8-10, you will be able to:

- Set up NVIDIA Isaac Sim with ROS 2 integration on GPU-enabled systems
- Create and import robot models using USD (Universal Scene Description) format
- Generate synthetic sensor data (RGB, depth, segmentation masks) for training
- Design parallel simulation environments for reinforcement learning experiments
- Train locomotion and manipulation policies using Isaac Lab and stable-baselines3
- Apply domain randomization techniques to improve sim-to-real transfer

## Key Topics

1. **Isaac Sim Platform**: Omniverse architecture, PhysX 5 engine, RTX ray tracing
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Replicator API, randomization workflows, dataset export
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Isaac Lab framework, parallel environments, reward shaping
4. **Sim-to-Real Pipeline**: Reality Gap analysis, system identification, fine-tuning strategies
5. **Advanced Applications**: Dexterous manipulation, bipedal locomotion, contact-rich tasks

## Section 1: Welcome (200-300 words)

- Hook: Physical AI is fundamentally different from digital AI
- Bridge from students' existing AI/ML knowledge to robotics
- Mention current excitement in humanoid robotics (2024-2025 breakthroughs)
- Preview what makes Physical AI challenging and exciting

## Section 2: Learning Objectives (List format)

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Define Physical AI and explain how it differs from digital AI systems
2. Understand the concept of embodied intelligence and why physical form matters
3. Identify major humanoid robotics companies and their technical approaches
4. Explain key sensor systems (LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors) and their limitations
5. Understand the sim-to-real gap and its implications for robot learning
6. Analyze multi-sensor fusion requirements for robust robot perception

## Section 3: Prerequisites (100-200 words)

**Required Background:**
- Python programming (functions, NumPy arrays, basic plotting)
- Machine learning fundamentals (neural networks, training/inference)
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)

**Helpful but Not Required:**
- Robotics experience
- Control theory
- Computer vision

## Section 4: Chapter Roadmap (300-400 words)

Brief overview of the 6 pages:

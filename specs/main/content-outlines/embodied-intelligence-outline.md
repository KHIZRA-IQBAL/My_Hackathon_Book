## Section 1: Introduction to Embodied Intelligence (250-350 words)

- Traditional AI view: Intelligence is computation (disembodied)
- Embodied AI view: Intelligence emerges from body-environment interaction
- Key insight: Intelligence is not just in the brain, but in the body
- Historical context: Brooks subsumption architecture, Pfeifer and Bongard work
- Cite academic papers from research.md on embodied intelligence

## Section 2: The Sensorimotor Loop (400-500 words)

- Definition: Continuous cycle of sensing, processing, acting, and sensing again
- How bodies shape intelligence
- Sensors determine what the world looks like to the agent
- Actuators determine what actions are possible
- Physical structure constrains and enables behaviors

Sensorimotor Loop Cycle:
1. Sense: Gather information from environment
2. Process: Interpret sensor data and decide on actions
3. Act: Execute motor commands
4. Sense again: Observe consequences of actions

- Example: Human catching a ball
- Robot example: Humanoid picking up a cup

## Section 3: Morphological Computation (400-600 words)

- Definition: Physical body structure performs computation without explicit control
- Intelligence is not just neural: body mechanics contribute to behavior

Examples:
1. Passive Dynamic Walkers
2. Compliant Hands
3. Springs and Dampers

Deep Dive on Morphological Computation (Collapsible admonition)
- Mathematical perspective
- Research paper links
- Trade-offs: versatility vs. specialization

## Section 4: Why the Humanoid Form Factor? (500-700 words)

Reason 1: Human Environments Are Designed for Humans
Reason 2: Tool Use and Manipulation
Reason 3: Social Interaction and Acceptance
Reason 4: Versatility vs. Specialization

Counterarguments and Limitations

## Section 5: Embodiment and Learning (300-400 words)

- Physical embodiment affects what can be learned
- Implications for robot learning
- Current research trends

## Section 6: Summary and Key Insights (200-250 words)

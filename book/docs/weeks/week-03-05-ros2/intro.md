# Week 3-5: ROS 2 Programming for Physical AI

## Overview

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is the industry-standard middleware for building modern robotic systems. This module introduces the fundamental concepts and practical skills needed to develop Physical AI applications using ROS 2 Humble, the current Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

You will learn how to structure robotic software using nodes, communicate between components using topics and services, and leverage ROS 2's built-in tools for simulation, visualization, and debugging. By the end of this module, you'll be able to build modular, real-time control systems for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 3-5, you will be able to:

- Create and manage ROS 2 packages using the colcon build system
- Implement publishers, subscribers, services, and actions in Python and C++
- Design message interfaces for sensor data and robot commands
- Use RViz2 for robot visualization and TF2 for coordinate frame transformations
- Debug and profile ROS 2 applications using built-in diagnostic tools
- Apply best practices for real-time performance and deterministic execution

## Key Topics

1. **ROS 2 Architecture**: DDS middleware, Quality of Service (QoS) profiles, executors
2. **Communication Patterns**: Topics (pub/sub), services (request/reply), actions (goal-based)
3. **Coordinate Frames**: TF2 library, robot kinematics, sensor fusion
4. **Simulation Integration**: Gazebo Classic, launch files, parameter configuration
5. **Hardware Interfaces**: ros2_control framework, real-time constraints

## Content Status

📝 **Full content coming soon!** This module is currently under development. Check back for:
- Detailed tutorials with code examples
- Hands-on exercises with simulated robots
- Video demonstrations of ROS 2 workflows
- Assessment questions and practical projects

For now, refer to the [official ROS 2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) to get started.

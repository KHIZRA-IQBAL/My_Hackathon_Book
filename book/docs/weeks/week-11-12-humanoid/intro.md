# Week 11-12: Full-Stack Humanoid Robot Development

## Overview

This capstone module integrates all previous concepts (Physical AI principles, ROS 2, simulation, NVIDIA Isaac) into a complete humanoid robot development workflow. You will work with industry-standard humanoid platforms and frameworks to build deployable systems for real-world tasks.

Drawing from the robotics landscape covered in Week 1-2 (Boston Dynamics Atlas, Tesla Optimus, Figure AI), you'll learn how leading companies structure their software stacks, from low-level motor control to high-level task planning. This module emphasizes practical engineering trade-offs and production-ready best practices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 11-12, you will be able to:

- Design full-body control systems for bipedal locomotion and manipulation
- Implement whole-body inverse kinematics and trajectory optimization
- Integrate vision-language models (VLMs) for human-robot interaction
- Deploy and monitor robot applications using Docker and cloud infrastructure
- Debug hardware-software integration issues in real-time systems
- Evaluate safety, reliability, and performance metrics for production deployments

## Key Topics

1. **Whole-Body Control**: Joint-space vs. task-space control, model predictive control (MPC)
2. **Hardware Integration**: Motor drivers, sensor calibration, latency optimization
3. **Perception Pipelines**: Object detection, pose estimation, scene understanding
4. **Task Planning**: Behavior trees, finite state machines, skill libraries
5. **Production Deployment**: Continuous integration, remote monitoring, over-the-air updates

## Content Status

📝 **Full content coming soon!** This module is currently under development. Check back for:
- Case studies from leading humanoid robotics companies
- End-to-end project template with reference implementation
- Video demonstrations of full-stack integration
- Interview preparation guide for Physical AI roles

For now, review open-source humanoid projects like [Unitree H1](https://github.com/unitreerobotics) and [Stanford Humanoid](https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub).
